    <h1>Graph Animations</h1>
<p> Since our focus is animation, i will only focus on Dr. B's transitions. Note that the code being referred to in the paragraph is green in color. <br> In the reading, we learn that adding transitions to changing visualizations is extremely simple using D3. With just a few lines of simple code we can make it possible. For example, simply chaining ".transition()" to our D3 algorithm can make the most basic transition happen for a changing visualization.  </p>
 <pre> svg.selectAll("rect")
.data(dataset)
<pre1>.transition()</pre1>
.attr("y", function(d) {
return h - yScale(d);
})
.attr("height", function(d) {
return yScale(d);
})
.attr("fill", "red"); </pre>
    <p> If we wanted to specify how long the transition period takes, we could simply add a ".duration()" line as shown below: </p>
    <pre>
    svg.selectAll("rect")
.data(dataset)
<pre1>.transition().duration(1000)</pre1>
.attr("y", function(d) {
return h - yScale(d);
})
.attr("height", function(d) {
return yScale(d);
})
.attr("fill", "red");
    </pre>
<p> Note that the duration is in miniseconds (ms), so the value 1000 represents 1 second.<br> To determine "how" the transition happens(how will the animation behave in terms of it's speed of changing as opposed to duration), we can use an ease() line.</p>
    <pre>
    .transition()
.duration(2000)
<pre1>.ease(d3.easeLinear)</pre1>
    </pre>
    <p> To make something happen at the start or end of a transition we can simply use a .on() function as shown: </p>
    <pre>
    <pre1>.on("start", </pre1>function() {
d3.select(this)
.transition()
.duration(250)
.attr("fill", "brown")
.attr("r", 3);
})</pre>
    <p>"start" would execute the function that comes after, at the beginning of the transition. "end" would execute it at the end.</p>
    <h2> Dr. B's code: </h2>
<p> Dr. B's transitions would likely have been something simple like this in his D3 chain:</p>    <pre> d3.select(this)
.transition()
.duration(250).ease(d3.easeLinear)
 </pre>
    <p> Although it looked amazing, this short chain of code should have done it, as explained above. </p>
